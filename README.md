# Detecting the Disturbance: A Nuanced View of Introspective Abilities in LLMs

This repository contains the official implementation and code for the **arXiv preprint** of our paper ["Detecting the Disturbance: A Nuanced View of Introspective Abilities in LLMs"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12411).

Our ["dataset"](https://huggingface.co/datasets/elyhahami/llama-introspection-complex-concepts) and ["steering vectors"](https://huggingface.co/elyhahami/llama-introspection-steering-vectors) are also available on huggingface. 

## Key Findings

### 1. Binary Detection is a Methodological Artifact
We show that the binary detection paradigm ("Did you detect an injected thought?") used in prior work conflates introspection with a simpler phenomenon: injection-induced global logit shifts that bias models toward affirmative responses *regardless of question content*. Detection accuracy and control question bias correlate at **r = 0.999**, with near-zero net signal across all 40 layer–strength configurations. The model isn't detecting the injection—it's just more likely to say "YES" to everything.

### 2. Partial Introspection is Real
Despite the negative result above, we find robust evidence for partial introspection on tasks requiring *differential* sensitivity:
- **Sentence Localization:** Models identify which of 10 sentences received an injection at up to **88% accuracy** (vs. 10% chance), with certain concept–layer combinations reaching 100%.
- **Strength Comparison:** Models discriminate relative injection strengths at up to **83% accuracy** (vs. 50% chance), with larger strength gaps yielding higher accuracy—indicating graded sensitivity to perturbation magnitude.

These tasks are immune to the global logit shift confound: a uniform bias toward "YES" cannot tell you *which* sentence was injected or *which* injection was stronger.

### 3. Introspection is Layer-Dependent
These capabilities are confined to early-layer injections (L0–L5) and collapse to chance levels beyond ~layer 10. This creates a narrow critical window where introspection succeeds—early enough for downstream signal integration, but before residual stream recovery dynamics attenuate the perturbation.

### 4. A Mechanistic Account Explains Why
We provide a three-part mechanistic explanation for the layer dependence:
- **Attention-based detection:** All 32 attention heads at the layer immediately after injection achieve **100% localization accuracy**. The injection creates a highly salient anomaly that attention mechanisms immediately identify.
- **Gradual integration:** Logit lens analysis shows the correct prediction emerges gradually over ~15 layers of downstream computation. The model needs processing depth to convert a detected anomaly into an explicit prediction.
- **Residual stream recovery:** The network actively attenuates perturbations, with cosine similarity returning toward baseline and projection onto the injection direction decaying exponentially.

Late-layer injections fail because there simply isn't enough computational runway for integration to complete before recovery erases the signal.
